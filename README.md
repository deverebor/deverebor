  <strong>Hello friend üëãüèΩ</strong>

  I currently work at <a href="https://loja.juntossomosmais.com.br/home" target="_blank">Juntos Somos Mais üß°</a>
  as a Front-End Software Engineer.

  Passionate about technology since I was 15,
  I've been studying since that day.

  Always me ventured into creating things,
  discovering and changing is what moves me.

  I love to learn and teach.

  Vue Evangelist, I'm always looking for
  new ways to improve my code.

  Even though I love Vue, I always study
  and improve my knowledge in other
  Frameworks like React and Next.

  - I've played basketball for almost 8 years in a roll

  I've also won beatbox championships!
