    <strong>Hello friend üëãüèΩ</strong>

    I currently work at <a href="https://loja.juntossomosmais.com.br/home" target="_blank">Juntos Somos Mais üß°</a>
    as a Front-End Software Engineer.

    Passionate about technology since I was 15,
    I've been studying since that day.

    Always me ventured into creating things,
    discovering and changing is what moves me.

    I love to learn and teach.

    Vue Evangelist, I'm always looking for
    new ways to improve my code.

    Even though I love Vue, I always study
    and improve my knowledge in other
    Frameworks like React and Next.
